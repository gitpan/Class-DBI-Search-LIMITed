NAME
    Class::DBI::Search::LIMITed - add 'LIMIT' to Class::DBI searches

SYNOPSIS
            use base 'Class::DBI';

            __PACKAGE__->add_searcher(
                    limited_search => 'Class::DBI::Search::LIMITed'
            );

            my @by_date = My::Class->limited_search( ... , {
                            order_by => 'name',
                            limit    => 10,
            });

            # or, if you want it to be the default search

            __PACKAGE__->add_searcher(
                    search => 'Class::DBI::Search::LIMITed'
            );

            my @by_date = My::Class->search( ... , {
                            order_by => 'name',
                            limit    => '20, 10',
            });

DESCRIPTION
    This is a simple search plugin to a Class::DBI subclass which allows for
    the addition of a LIMIT option to a SELECT query.

METHODS
  add_searcher
            __PACKAGE__->add_searcher(
                    method_name => 'Class::DBI::Search::LIMITed'
            );

    As with all Search plugins you can choose the method name for the search
    that it generates. You can either make a distinct limit-ed search method
    (e.g. search_limited()), or just make it your default search() method.

  fragment
    This overrides the default 'fragment' method in
    Class::DBI::Search::Basic to add any 'limit' option passed in your
    search query.

CAVEATS
    This is only useful for databases which support a LIMIT modifier, such
    as MySQL.
